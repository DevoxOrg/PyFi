# About: #

This is a personal finance package I started to automate my own financial analysis and to cut out any human error from doing it manually.

Originally this project was intended to be a Python VBA mashup so that most of the analysis could be done in Excel after Python compiled the CSVs into a unified format. 

As is the nature of projects, the direction of this one has become ever changing. Currently the main aim is to create a more comprehensive pure python program that will allow more in depth analysis and modelling of personal financial data.
