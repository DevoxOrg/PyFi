So far I have split this project into 5 phases, each of which will have it's own set of objectives:

# Phase 1: #
        - Create a compiling program to unify the various different CSV styles from each bank 
        - This has now been expanded to include QIF and OFX. A planned user defined method is in the works.

# Phase 2: # 
        - Originally planned to build a tkinter GUI, now a Qt GUI with PySide. Further functionality and manipulation of the data will be added at this point
        
# Phase 3: #
        - Integrate MatPlotLib with the GUI to allow proper visualisation of the data.

# Phase 4: #
        - Create an interface to script Python codes allowing modelling and further analysis of the data. This will integrate the more advanced mathematical libraries of Python.

# Phase 5: #
        - Package the program for all OS's, test and write up documentation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Questionable Phase 6 - Port the program to a lower level language.

The current status of the project puts us at phase 2 and 3.
