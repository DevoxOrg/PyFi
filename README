This is a personal finance package I started to automate my own financial analysis and to cut out any human error from doing it manually.

Originally this project was intended to be a Python VBA mashup so that most of the analysis could be done in Excel after Python compiled the CSVs into a unified format. 

As is the nature of projects, the direction of this one has become ever changing. Currently the main aim is to create a more comprehensive pure python program that will allow more in depth analysis and modelling of personal financial data.

So far I have split this project into 5 phases, each of which will have it's own set of objectives:

Phase 1 - Create a compiling program to unify the various different CSV styles from each bank 
        - This has now been expanded to include QIF and OFX. A planned user defined method is in the works.

Phase 2 - Originally planned to build a tkinter GUI, now a Qt GUI with PySide. Further functionality and manipulation of the data will be added at this point
        
Phase 3 - Integrate MatPlotLib with the GUI to allow proper visualisation of the data.

Phase 4 - Create an interface to script Python codes allowing modelling and further analysis of the data. This will integrate the more advanced mathematical libraries of Python.

Phase 5 - Package the program for all OS's, test and write up documentation.

Questionable Phase 6 - Port the program to a lower level language.

The current status of the project puts us at phase 2 and 3.

Current possibilities:

Add in a Chromium based browser to the interface. Create an applet to scrape statement information directly off of the internet.

Possibly integrate live checking while online for increased security.
