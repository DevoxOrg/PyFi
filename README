This is a personal finance package I started to automate my own financial analysis and to cut out any human error from doing it manually.

Originally this project was intended to be a Python VBA mashup so that most of the analysis could be done in Excel after Python compiled the CSVs into a unified format. 

However the intention changed so that I am now aiming to complete the entire project in Python and some other languages. The main motivation for this is firstly to learn how to use Python better and play with a few new libraries. Ultimately this would also allow the use of the NumPy/SciPy libraries to create a more advanced method of analysis of the data. It will also allow a convenient interface to interact with the data in Python.

So far I have split this project into 5 phases:

Phase 1 - Create a compiling programme to unify the various different CSV styles from each bank 
        - This has now been expanded to include QIF and OFX.

Phase 2 - Create a basic user interface with TKinter for the compiler. This will add further functionality and control over the compiler and how the data is formatted. 
        - This has now been expanded to a possible Java interface.

Phase 3 - Create a graphical UI with MatPlotLib to allow visualisation of the data - at this point the project should be useable for basic purposes without having to import master files to Excel/Calc.

Phase 4 - Create an interface to script Python codes allowing modelling and further analysis of the data. This will integrate the more advanced mathematical libraries of Python.

Phase 5 - Package the programme for all OS's, test and write up documentation.

Current possibilities:

Add in a Chromium based browser to the interface. Create an applet to scrape statement information directly off of the internet.

Possibly integrate live checking while online for increased security.
